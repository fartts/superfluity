  "description": "Neon has the unique quality of representing contrasting ideas about our future. In form and in color, its natural hues represent an optimistic and technologically-fueled tomorrow. Simultaneously, its past applications are fading into ruin, marking failed attempts at establishing utopia. Through medium and metaphor, the artists in NEON explore this strange duality.",
